They don't exist where I live.","answer":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/drsocko.com\/blogs\/news\/what-are-hospital-socks\" title=\"https:\/\/drsocko.com\/blogs\/news\/what-are-hospital-socks\">Hospital grip socks<\/a>, otherwise known as non-slip\/non-skid socks, are used in hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes to help patients prevent accidental falls, keep warm, and protect feet from bacteria. They are especially useful for elderly and patients in recovery. We've heard several requests for changes in the traditional hospital grip sock, like making it fitted, removing the toe seam, and creating fun designs. We've launched our own take on hospital grip socks based on this and hope you love it as much as the traditional ones!<\/p>"}},"1658496974d5cbc0ef-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Can I buy Dr. Socko if I'm not in the ER?","answer":"<p>Of course!

Hospital socks might be a positive memory during a rough time in the hospital. Or maybe it was something that kept you warm in the cold ER. Or maybe it was a gift from a family member. Or maybe it was something free you got out of a hospital visit that ended up becoming the go-to at home loungewear. Whatever the reason may be, we hope Dr. Socko can be a special memory as well.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["c65daded-0c6b-4864-a200-b5efde509f3e","1658496974d5cbc0ef-1","1658496974d5cbc0ef-0","e4c48de4-9339-46cd-9999-4663d23cce89"],"settings":{"title":"About Dr. Socko"}},"faq-content-1":{"type":"collapsible-tabs","blocks":{"question-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What size should I buy?","answer":"<p>If you’re not quite sure which size is right for you, refer to our <a href=\"https:\/\/drsocko.com\/pages\/sizing-chart\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/drsocko.com\/pages\/sizing-chart\">size guides here<\/a>. <\/p>"}},"question-2":{"type":"question","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Can I cancel my order?","answer":"<p>We completely get it, we change our minds too!
